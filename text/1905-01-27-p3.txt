EGYPT’S BANKING DEVELOPMENTS

COMPTOIR D’ESCOMPTE

The great French banking house, the Comptoir National d’Escompte, has secured the Palazzo Antoniades in Cherif Pasha street, Alexandria, as premises for its agency here. This is the only private house standing by itself in Cherif Pasha-street and it will be a magnificent site for a bank. It has been leased to the Comptoir National d Escompte for a period of ten years at a rental of L.E. 2,000 a year, including the garden and all the appurtenances of this fine mansion. The bank has also obtained the option of renewing the lease at the end of the term.

The bank intends to build on to thé garden at the back of the building and to turn the house into large and commodious banking premises. Mr. Llewelyn, who is to represent the bank as general manager for Egypt, will stay at Alexandria permanently and will take charge of all - the bank's operations in this country.

The building will bo transformed immediately and the bank will be fully installed early in the coming summer.

The Comptoir National d'Escompte has a capital of 150,000,000 francs, fully paid up, m 300,000 shares of 500 francs each. It is a Société Anonyme, which took over the business of the Comptoir d'Esoompte de Paris, which went into liquidation in 1889. The duration of the company is 50 years from 1st May, 1889. The business of the Banque de Dépôts et Comptes Courants was taken over from July, 1892, for 30,000 fully-paid shares. It is one of the greatest banks in France and on a par with the Credit Lyonnais. The directors anticipate a rapid development of business in Egypt. An agency in Cairo will be opened next year and it is probable that the bank will also extend its sphere of operations to the Sudan.

EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT AND AGENCY.

The Egyptian Investment and Agency, Limited, yesterday received the final list of subscribers in Egypt and the officials of the company are hard at work getting the allotments ready.

Over 2,450 applications for more than 3,250,000 shares were received here, and wo learn that the public will get 2-5% on most applications for above 500. Below that figure, and in a few other cases, letters of regret will have to be sent. These it is hoped to post to-night or to-morrow. The allotment letters will follow next week.

DELTA LIGHT RAILWAY CO.

The Egyptian Delta Light Railways (Limited) announces that coupons tor accumulated arrears of dividend on the 5 and 1/2 per Cent Cumulative Preference Shares to the 30th September, 1904, are now ready for issue. Share warrants to bearer and registered certificates must be lodged either at the offices of the company, 211, Gresham House, Old Broad-street, Loudon, or with the National Bank of Egypt, Cairo or Alexandria, for endorsement shares Nos. 1 to 63,324 are entitled to Coupon F for 14s. per share, less income tax ; shares Nos. 63,325 to 74,437 are entitled to Coupon G for 1s. 4d. per share, less income tax , and Shares Nos. 74,438 to 85.540 are entitled to Coupon H for Is. per share, loss income tax

THE MAHMAL THEFT.

No trace whatever has been discovered of either the money stolen from the Mahmal caravan or the thieves, and it has transpired that though it was the intention of the authorities to couple the specie van and the van containing the guard some ingenious person interposed no less than 16 other trucks. Under these circumstances it is hard to say whether the theft took place at Abbassieh or during the journey, and it has not been established that the specie van was under observation during the whole of the time that it was standing on the line at Abbassieh.

We should have thought that the simplest precaution would have been the most effectual, namely, to put a couple of soldiers with loaded rifles into the specie van ; but this plan, which is universally employed in India, never seems to have struck the responsible authorities. Meantime, £8,000 have disappeared, and as far as we can see this will figure in next year’s accounts under the heading of "Unforeseen Expenditure."

provincial councils.

By Khédivial decree the Provincial Councils of Assiout, Keneh, Girgeh, Beni Souef, and Ghizeh are to meet on Sunday next at 9 am. at the Mondiriehs to take the oath and to elect delegates to the Legislative Council.
